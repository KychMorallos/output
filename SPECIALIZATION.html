            <h2><b>SPECIALIZATION</b></h2>
            <p>As a student determined to wield my own power—my talents—I pursued the goal of earning the title of "multi-talented." That journey began in 4th grade when I entered the Special Program in the Arts at DASJMS (Delegate Angel Salazar Jr. Memorial School).</p>
            
            <p>Being a 4th-grade transferee, I was unfamiliar with how the program worked. So, when the first round of specializations was announced, I was confused as my classmates hurried off to their respective talent-based classes. The last group to be called were the Dance Majors. Outside, older students waited, their eyes fixed on me—the newbie. Not wanting to be left behind, I simply followed them. And just like that, my Dance Era began. It was here that I discovered my love for ballet.</p>
            
            <p>By 5th grade, I had fully embraced being a dance major. I loved it. But despite my passion, I knew deep down that dance was not my true talent. I had to make a difficult choice—to let go of dance and return to my natural gift: music. It was bittersweet, but I reminded myself that this was the path I had chosen. And so, my Music Era began.</p>
            
            <p>From 5th to 10th grade, I embraced music once again and performed. This year may be my last as a specialized student, but it will always be a part of me. I am born with talent and shall grow with talent.</p>
      
            <p>From 5th to 10th grade, I dedicated myself to music, performing and growing with every note I sang. Now, as I near the end of my specialized journey, I know that music will always be a part of me. I was born with talent, and I will continue to grow with it.</p>
            <p>  
My journey through the *Special Program in the Arts* has been a path of discovery, growth, and passion. From stepping into the unknown as a dance major to embracing my true calling in music, every experience has shaped me into the artist I am today. Though this chapter may be coming to an end, my love for the arts will never fade. Talent is not just something we are born with—it is something we nurture, refine, and carry with us. As I move forward, I will continue to grow, create, and let my talents shine. This is not the end of my journey; it is just the beginning.</p>
