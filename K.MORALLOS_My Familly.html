            <h2><b>MY FAMILY</b></h2>
            <p>My family is my greatest blessing, a constant source of love, strength, and support. No matter what challenges arise, I know I can always rely on them. We walk through lifeâ€™s journey together, uplifting and encouraging one another every step of the way. Our bond is unbreakable, built on trust, care, and unconditional loveâ€”and in the end, thatâ€™s all that truly matters.</p>

            <h2><b>MY PARENTS</b></h2>
            <p>I have an amazing, hardworking, and inspiring father, Kirk B. Morallosâ€”better known to us as Daddy King. Many of my talents and intelligence come from him. He is firm when it comes to discipline and constantly reminds us to be good and principled individuals.  

            My mother, Algen S. Morallosâ€”our beloved Mommy Bingâ€”is incredibly "street-smart" and serves as our family's very own human calculator. She has a passion for singing, with *Knife* being her go-to karaoke song. While she can be strict, she also has her cool and fun moments, making her the heart of our home.</p>

            <h2><b>MY SIBLINGS</b></h2>
            <p>My siblings are my lifelong partners in crimeâ€”though not in any actual crimes, of course! ðŸ˜† They are my closest companions, my biggest supporters, and the ones who make every moment more memorable. So, without further ado, let me introduce you to my amazing siblings! ðŸŽ‰âœ¨</p>

            <h2><b>MY OLDER SISTER</b></h2>
            <p>Ate Candy, or "Schenzie" (Nash Schenzie Kei S. Morallos), is my role model. She has always been like a second parent to us, embodying both kindness and discipline. Not only is she an incredibly gorgeous sister, but she is also independent, talented, and someone I deeply admire. Sheâ€™s my idol and my best friend! Our bond is built on trustâ€”weâ€™re so close that we even share secrets.</p>
            <img src="file:///C:/10%20SPA/ate.jpg" alt="Ate Candy" class="profile-img profile-img-center">

            <h2><b>MY YOUNGER BROTHER</b></h2>
            <p>Mcdondie, or McDonalds (Hyx Dempsey McVien S. Morallos), is a natural charmer with a great sense of humor. He has a brilliant mind, remarkable talents, and excels even in sports. His determination and hard work set him apart, and I truly believe he can achieve anything he sets his mind to! ðŸ˜Š</p>
            <img src="file:///C:/10%20SPA/dondie.jpg" alt="Mcdondie" class="profile-img profile-img-center">

            <h2><b>MY YOUNGER SISTER</b></h2>
            <p>Baby Eahnie (Yasharee Bitney Mineah S. Morallos) is a bold, friendly, and sassy genius. Despite being just eight, she has already started her own small businessâ€”a true testament to her talent and determination. She is kind-hearted, full of life, and brings so much joy and warmth into our home.</p>

            <p>I'm still in this phase of my life, where Iâ€™ve started convincing myself to grow up and be independent. This is also where my teenage years, dramatic phases, and introduction to reality began. High school is also when romance first started to play a role in my life.</p>
