            <h2>Myself</h2>
            <p>
               I am Kych Miuqui Daine S. Morallos, but you can call me Miyuki or Myokai. I’m a 14-year-old music program student at Antique National School. My name was inspired by the fantasy-historical world of Harry Potter because my dad is a huge fan. Born on September 27, 2009, in Batasan Hills, Quezon City, I came into the world right after storms Peping and Ondoy—yes, my arrival was as stormy and chaotic as the weather that year. As a Libra, I like to think I bring balance, even when life gets crazy.
            </p>

            <p>
                I’m the second of four siblings, born to Algen S. Morallos and Kirk B. Morallos—two incredibly smart and strict parents. What makes them interesting is how they switch roles: my mom is the hands-on, fix-it genius, while my dad enjoys making desserts and growing plants. In our house, he’s part husband, part wife, and my mom is part wife, part husband. Since they’re both teachers, we never needed tutors—education was always part of our daily lives.
            </p>

            <p>Now, let me introduce my multi-talented siblings. My older sister, Nash Schenzie Kei, is smart, independent, and beautiful, with a passion for singing. My younger brother, Hyx Dempsey Mcvien, is a gymnast, dancer, and singer—basically an all-around performer. Then there’s my little sister, Yasharee Bitney Meneah, a true Gen Z who collects lomo cards and even composes her own music. As for me? I shine in my own way. I love to sing, create both digital and traditional art, and dream of writing a book before I die.
            </p>

            <p>
                Fun fact: As a kid, I wanted to be a scientist—and not just that, I wanted to try every profession in the world! But reality hit me: I’d need to study for a hundred years, and unfortunately, a human lifespan isn’t that long. So, I set my sights on something equally ambitious—I want to be a Doctor-Lawyer (Doc-Atty).

People say my spirit animal is a bunny because I run around a lot. I’m an ambivert, a lover of art, deeply connected to my family, and, at the end of the day, just a human trying to leave my mark on the world.
