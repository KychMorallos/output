            <h2>Pre-School</h2>
            <p>My pre-school years were some of the happiest times of my life, free from worries about the future. My only goal was to have fun and go home with stars stamped on my hands. I loved performing and enjoyed participating in pageants, speeches, and talent shows at school. I still remember the immense effort my parents put into encouraging me to always do my best.</p>

            <h2>Elementary</h2>
            <p>This was when I started to understand life on a deeper level. I worked hard to achieve the best grades and actively participated in student body elections. During this time, I met wonderful people who filled my childhood with love, happiness, and even moments of sadness—teaching me that life isn’t always just a game. These experiences helped me grow, evolve, and strive to become a better version of myself.</p>
                       
            <h2>High School</h2>
            <p>I’m still in this phase of my life, navigating the journey of growing up and learning independence. High school has been a time of self-discovery, dramatic phases, and facing the realities of life. It’s also where I’ve begun to experience the complexities of romance, adding yet another layer to this transformative stage of my journey.</p>
            <p>I'm still in this phase of my life, where I’ve started convincing myself to grow up and be independent. This is also where my teenage years, dramatic phases, and introduction to reality began. High school is also when romance first started to play a role in my life.</p>
